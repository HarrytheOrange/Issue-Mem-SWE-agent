    signature: "exp_search <query>"
    docstring: |
      Semantic search client for the local bug-fix experience database.
      Returns a ranked list of candidates. Each candidate contains an `ID` and an `Issue Content` preview.
      Use the `ID` with `exp_read` if you want to inspect the full fix experience.

      Output sketch:
      [1] ID: <repo__issue_id>
          Issue Content: <preview...>
          ...

      Usage examples:
      - exp_search "IndexError when accessing array out of bounds"
      - exp_search "memory leak in data processing loop"
    arguments:
      - name: query
        type: string
        description: |
          Search query string. Use any concrete clues you have (exact error messages, exception names,
          stack trace terms, library/framework names, file/function names, symptoms).
          You can iterate: rewrite/decompose/follow-up queries and run multiple searches as your understanding improves.
