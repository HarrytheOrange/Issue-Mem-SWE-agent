      Integrated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) client for the local bug-fix experience database.
      This tool combines search and retrieval into a single step. It performs a semantic search based on your query and immediately returns the **full detailed content** of the Top-3 most relevant bug fix experiences.

      Use this tool to quickly gain insights from historical fixes without needing to search and read separately.

      Usage examples:
      - exp_rag "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'"
      - exp_rag "race condition in database connection pool"

      Notes:
      - Returns the full 'fix_experience' text for the top 3 matches.
      - Includes Repository name, Issue ID, and the detailed solution/analysis.
      - You do NOT need to use 'exp_read' after this; all necessary information is provided in the output.
