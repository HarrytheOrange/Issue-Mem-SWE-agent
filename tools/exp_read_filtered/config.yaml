      Fetch the full bug-fix experience for a single candidate, but only return it if it looks relevant to the CURRENT SWE problem.

      This tool automatically reads the original SWE problem statement from the environment variable `PROBLEM_STATEMENT`
      (the agent must NOT provide it as an argument), and uses a chat model to judge relevance.
      If the experience is likely helpful, the full narrative is returned. Otherwise, it returns: `NOT_HELPFUL`.
