        "episodic_memory": "In this incident, a user reported that the console command used to download a GitHub-hosted API (pgoapi) via requirements.txt did not work. The original requirements.txt entry was:\n\n- `-e git://github.com/tejado/pgoapi.git@1f25e907f3e5f1b603330e71041e1ad7bee7580f#egg=pgoapi`\n\nOn the user's machine, running `pip install -r requirements.txt` would hang at the step where pip tried to fetch the pgoapi repository from GitHub. Another maintainer confirmed that the syntax should be valid according to pip documentation and that it worked in their environment, but the reporter continued to encounter issues (likely environment-specific, e.g., Windows and/or lack of proper git support for the `git://` protocol in that terminal).\n\nOne maintainer suggested changing the requirement to an HTTPS-based URL pinned to a specific commit:\n\n- `-e git+https://github.com/tejado/pgoapi.git@1f25e907f3e5f1b603330e71041e1ad7bee7580f#egg=pgoapi`\n\nand another suggested ensuring git was installed and using Git Bash on Windows. The patch that was actually proposed in the PR simplified the requirement line to:\n\n- `git+https://github.com/tejado/pgoapi.git`\n\n(removing the editable flag, commit pin, and egg fragment, and switching from `git://` to `git+https://`). This change avoids the `git://` protocol and uses HTTPS, which is generally more reliable across different environments and firewalls. The discussion concluded with closing the issue, implying that either using HTTPS or adjusting the local git/pip environment resolved the installation hang.",
        "semantic_memory": "Git-based dependencies in pip requirements.txt are sensitive to URL scheme, environment, and tooling. Using the `git://` protocol can cause problems on some systems (especially Windows or environments where that protocol is blocked or unsupported). In contrast, `git+https://` is more broadly compatible because it uses standard HTTPS and works better behind proxies and common firewalls.\n\nWhen specifying GitHub repos in requirements.txt, best practices include:\n- Prefer `git+https://` URLs over `git://` or SSH-only URLs for maximum portability.\n- Ensure that git is installed and available on the PATH of the environment where pip is running.\n- Pin to a specific commit, tag, or branch when reproducibility is important (e.g., `@<commit-hash>`), and include `#egg=<name>` when needed so pip can resolve the package name correctly.\n- Be aware that editable installs (`-e`) may behave differently from non-editable ones and might not be necessary when just consuming a library.\n\nInstallation hangs or failures during pip's \"Collecting\" or \"Installing from VCS\" step are often not Python bugs but environment issues: missing git, network restrictions, or incompatible VCS URL schemes. Changing the URL scheme (e.g., to HTTPS) or fixing the local git setup typically resolves these problems.",

            "Step-by-step instructions on how to diagnose and fix similar issues.",
            "Step 1: Reproduce the problem explicitly. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` with increased verbosity (e.g., `pip install -vvv -r requirements.txt`) and note at which requirement pip hangs or fails.",
            "Step 2: Identify any VCS-based requirements (those starting with `git+`, `git://`, `hg+`, etc.) in requirements.txt. Focus first on the one pip is stuck on.",
            "Step 3: Check that git is installed and on your PATH. Run `git --version` in the same shell where you run pip. If this fails, install git (e.g., from https://git-scm.com/downloads) and restart the terminal.",
            "Step 4: If the requirement uses `git://` or SSH (e.g., `git@github.com:...`), change it to an HTTPS-based URL, such as `git+https://github.com/<user>/<repo>.git`. This avoids issues with restricted protocols or missing SSH keys.",
            "Step 5: If reproducibility is required, pin the dependency to a known commit, tag, or branch, for example: `git+https://github.com/<user>/<repo>.git@<commit-hash>#egg=<package_name>`. Keep or remove the `-e` (editable) flag depending on whether you need an editable checkout.",
            "Step 6: Update requirements.txt with the new URL and re-run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Verify that pip now proceeds past the previous hang point.",
            "Step 7: If the issue persists, test installing that single dependency directly, e.g., `pip install -vvv git+https://github.com/<user>/<repo>.git`, to isolate errors (such as authentication, SSL, or proxy issues).",
            "Step 8: Once a working URL and configuration are found, commit the updated requirements.txt so other users do not encounter the same installation problem."
