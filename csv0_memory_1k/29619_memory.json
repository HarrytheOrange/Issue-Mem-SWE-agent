        "episodic_memory": "In this pull request, the developer updated the Home Assistant `auth` integration and its tests to comply with PEP8 import ordering, using isort. The affected files were `homeassistant/components/auth/__init__.py`, `indieauth.py`, `login_flow.py`, `mfa_setup_flow.py`, and several test modules under `tests/components/auth/`. Changes included: (1) grouping imports into standard library, third-party, and local sections; (2) alphabetizing imports within those groups; (3) normalizing `from ... import ...` order, such as `from homeassistant.core import HomeAssistant, callback` instead of `callback, HomeAssistant`; (4) collapsing multiple relative imports into a single statement (e.g., `.indieauth, login_flow, mfa_setup_flow`); (5) removing an unnecessary blank line in a test `__init__.py`; and (6) reordering test imports so that Home Assistant modules are imported before test utilities. The change was purely stylistic; there was no bug or behavioral defect, but the refactor improves consistency, readability, and maintainability, and makes it easier to run automated tools like isort in the future. All tests passed (`tox`), confirming there was no functional regression.",
        "semantic_memory": "Consistent import ordering according to PEP8 and enforced by tools like isort is an important code quality practice even when it does not change runtime behavior. PEP8 recommends grouping imports into three sections (standard library, third-party, and local application imports), separating these groups with blank lines, and ordering imports alphabetically within each group. Within `from module import a, b` forms, it is also beneficial to order imported names consistently and predictably (usually alphabetically). Automated tools such as isort can apply these conventions uniformly across a codebase, reducing style-related noise in code review and preventing merge conflicts from manually edited import blocks. For test code, following the same import-order conventions helps keep tests readable and aligned with application code. Non-functional refactors like these should still be accompanied by full test runs to ensure that reordering imports has not inadvertently changed initialization order in a way that affects side effects (e.g., monkey patching, logging configuration, or module-level initialization).",

            "When standardizing import order to PEP8/isort across a module or integration:",
            "Step 1: Identify the target files (modules and tests) whose imports need to be normalized (e.g., `components/auth/*.py` and matching `tests/components/auth/*.py`).",
            "Step 2: Configure isort according to the project's styling rules (often via `pyproject.toml`, `setup.cfg`, or `.isort.cfg`), aligning with PEP8 and any repo-specific conventions (e.g., treating the project's top-level package as a 'first-party' section).",
            "Step 3: Run isort on the selected files (e.g., `isort homeassistant/components/auth tests/components/auth`). Use the same isort version and config as the rest of the project to avoid churn.",
            "Step 4: Review the diff to ensure the changes are indeed non-functional: imports should be regrouped and reordered, but no names should be removed or changed. Watch out for subtle issues where import reordering may affect side effects if code relies on import-time execution order.",
            "Step 5: Clean up any manual style issues not automatically fixed by isort, such as extra blank lines or inconsistent grouping that violate the project's style but weren't caught by the tool.",
            "Step 6: Run the full test suite (e.g., `tox` or `pytest`) to confirm behavior is unchanged. Even though import reordering is intended to be mechanical, tests ensure that no hidden import-order dependency was introduced or broken.",
            "Step 7: In the PR description, clearly state that this is a style-only change (PEP8/isort import sorting) with no functional modifications. This helps reviewers understand the scope and review primarily for correctness of tool application.",
            "Step 8: For future changes, encourage developers to run isort pre-commit or as part of CI to keep import ordering consistent and avoid large, noisy diffs."
