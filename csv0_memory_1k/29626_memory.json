        "episodic_memory": "In this pull request, the Home Assistant 'cloud' integration and its associated tests were updated to have their imports sorted according to PEP8 using isort. The affected files included several core cloud modules (account_link.py, alexa_config.py, binary_sensor.py, client.py, google_config.py, prefs.py, tts.py, utils.py) and multiple test modules under tests/components/cloud. The changes are strictly stylistic: reordering imports, grouping them logically (standard library, third-party, local), and cleaning up minor spacing inconsistencies. For example, the cloud client module now imports logging before other modules and groups Alexa and Google Assistant related imports more clearly. The prefs and config modules had their constant imports reordered for consistency. Some two-name imports were reordered alphabetically (e.g., from aiohttp import payload, web instead of web, payload). No behavior, algorithms, or business logic were altered, and the PR confirms that tests pass with tox. The purpose of this PR is to improve readability, maintainability, and adherence to PEP8 rather than to fix a functional bug.",
        "semantic_memory": "This change illustrates the general best practice of using automated tooling (isort) to enforce consistent import ordering and PEP8 compliance across a codebase. Sorting imports into clear groups (standard library, third-party packages, internal modules) and ordering names alphabetically within those groups improves readability, reduces merge conflicts, and makes diffs easier to review. Applying such changes module-wide or component-wide in a single focused PR helps avoid mixing formatting changes with logical changes, which can obscure the real intent of future modifications. It also highlights the importance of re-running test suites even for ostensibly non-functional refactors to catch accidental breakages (for instance, if circular imports or conditional imports existed). Automated style enforcement (via isort, black, flake8, etc.) is best integrated into CI and pre-commit hooks so that developers do not need to manually manage style, and the repository maintains a consistent coding standard over time.",

            "When standardizing import order in a codebase, treat it as a dedicated, non-functional refactor and verify tests still pass.",
            "Step 1: Identify scope and tools – Decide which part of the codebase needs import standardization (e.g., a single integration/module) and confirm the intended style (PEP8, project-specific rules) and tool configuration (e.g., isort config in pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, or .isort.cfg).",
            "Step 2: Configure isort – Ensure isort is installed and configured according to the project’s conventions (e.g., known_first_party, known_third_party, multi-line output style). Align these settings with existing CI/linting rules if present.",
            "Step 3: Run isort on the target modules – Execute isort over the chosen directories (for example, `isort homeassistant/components/cloud tests/components/cloud`) so imports are automatically grouped and sorted.",
            "Step 4: Inspect diffs – Review the changes to confirm that only import order, grouping, and trivial whitespace were modified. Verify no imports were unintentionally added, removed, or altered in a way that changes semantics (e.g., star imports, conditional imports).",
            "Step 5: Run tests – Even though changes are stylistic, run the full test suite (e.g., `tox`) to ensure there are no hidden issues such as circular import side effects or import-time behavior changes.",
            "Step 6: Keep the PR focused – Submit the changes as a dedicated formatting/cleanup PR. Clearly state that the change is non-functional and only affects import ordering/style, which simplifies code review.",
            "Step 7: Integrate into workflow – To avoid recurring large diffs, add isort (and any other formatters) to pre-commit hooks and/or CI so that future contributions conform to the same import ordering rules automatically."
