        "episodic_memory": "In this PR, the Optuna project improved its GitHub `questions-help-support` issue template to better handle user questions about how to use Optuna with other libraries. The maintainers found it difficult to answer many questions because users often did not provide enough context, particularly code and environment details. To address this, the PR added an optional 'Information for reproducibility' section to the template. This section asks users for (1) environment information (Optuna version, Python version, OS, and optionally other libraries and versions), (2) error messages, stack traces, or logs, (3) explicit steps to reproduce, and (4) a minimal reproducible Python code example. These additions do not change any runtime behavior of the library; they only change the GitHub issue template to encourage users to submit more actionable questions. The PR was accepted and merged, with a note that a future follow-up may add a thin module to show runtime information automatically.",
        "semantic_memory": "When a library project receives many usage and integration questions, core maintainers often struggle to answer them efficiently if issues lack reproducible context. A practical solution is to enhance GitHub issue templates to guide users toward providing structured, reproducible information. This typically includes: environment details (library versions, Python version, OS, relevant dependencies), the exact error output or logs, explicit steps to reproduce, and a minimal, self-contained code example. Making this section optional but prominently visible balances usability (not scaring off casual questioners) with support efficiency (giving maintainers what they need to reproduce issues). Aligning templates across similar issue types (e.g., bug reports vs. questions) ensures consistency in the information gathered and improves triage and debugging speed. While not a code fix, these process-level improvements can significantly reduce back-and-forth communication and time-to-resolution for both bugs and usage questions.",

            "Step-by-step instructions on how to diagnose and fix similar issues.",
            "Step 1: Identify pain points in current support/issue handling. Look at recent questions or bug reports where maintainers requested more information (code, environment, logs) and note recurring missing details.",
            "Step 2: Decide which issue templates need improvement (e.g., questions/help/support, bug reports, feature requests). For usage questions that require seeing user code, focus on the questions/help/support template.",
            "Step 3: Design a reproducibility section that is clearly labeled and optionally marked as 'optional' to avoid intimidating users. Include subsections for: (a) Environment (library version, language version, OS, and optionally other dependencies), (b) Error messages/stack traces/logs, (c) Steps to reproduce, (d) Minimal reproducible example code.",
            "Step 4: Edit the relevant GitHub issue template file in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` (e.g., `questions-help-support.md`). Insert the new reproducibility section after the main question prompt, using Markdown headings and HTML comments to guide users on how to fill it out.",
            "Step 5: In the template, provide placeholder bullets and fenced code blocks. For example, bullets for environment info, a fenced code block for logs, numbered list for steps to reproduce, and a fenced Python block for minimal code. Use comments to explain why each piece of information is helpful.",
            "Step 6: Keep the section optional but encourage its use by explaining that providing this information makes it easier and faster to get a useful answer. Avoid making all fields mandatory to reduce friction for simple questions.",
            "Step 7: Align the new section with existing templates. If there is a well-structured bug-report template, mirror its reproducibility fields so maintainers see consistent information across issue types.",
            "Step 8: Open a PR with the template changes and communicate the motivation: reduced back-and-forth, faster support, easier reproduction. Collect feedback from maintainers/support engineers and adjust wording or fields as needed.",
            "Step 9: After merging, monitor new issues to see if users start providing better reproducible examples. If necessary, iterate on the template wording or structure (e.g., making some parts more prominent or clarifying what 'minimal reproducible example' means).",
            "Step 10: Optionally, complement the template with tools or scripts (e.g., a small module that prints environment/runtime info) and reference them in the template so users can easily gather the requested details."
