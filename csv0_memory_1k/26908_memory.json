        "episodic_memory": "In the Home Assistant project, the CI build was failing for the xiaomi_aqara integration due to a flake8 style error: `E226 missing whitespace around arithmetic operator` on line 327 in `homeassistant/components/xiaomi_aqara/__init__.py`. The problematic line calculated a voltage value as `round(voltage/1000.0, 2)`, which violated PEP8/flake8's requirement for spaces around arithmetic operators. The fix changed this to `round(voltage / 1000.0, 2)`, inserting a space before and after the `/` operator. No functional behavior changed; this was purely a formatting fix to satisfy the linter and restore a passing build.",
        "semantic_memory": "Static analysis and linting tools (like flake8) are often wired into CI pipelines so that style violations cause build failures. Even seemingly trivial formatting issues, such as missing whitespace around arithmetic operators, can prevent merges and releases. Maintaining consistent style per PEP8 (in Python projects) is not just cosmetic; it can be a gating factor enforced by automation. Arithmetic operators in Python code should have spaces around them (e.g., `a + b`, `x / y`) unless there is a deliberate, justified exception (such as in some numerical code or keyword arguments). When a build fails on a style error, the correct remediation is to adjust the code to conform to the style rules, not to bypass the linter, except in exceptional circumstances. This encourages readability, consistency, and reduces review friction.",

            "Step-by-step instructions on how to diagnose and fix similar issues.",
            "Step 1: Inspect the CI/lint error message. Look at the exact file path, line number, and error code (e.g., `homeassistant/components/xiaomi_aqara/__init__.py:327:68: E226 missing whitespace around arithmetic operator`). Identify which linter (flake8, pylint, etc.) is complaining.",
            "Step 2: Open the referenced file at the specified line and column. Examine the expression or statement flagged by the linter. For E226 in Python, look for arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, etc.) without spaces around them.",
            "Step 3: Apply the relevant style rule. For missing whitespace around arithmetic operators, add a single space on both sides of the operator, e.g., change `voltage/1000.0` to `voltage / 1000.0`. Ensure you don’t unintentionally alter operator precedence or logic.",
            "Step 4: Re-run the linter locally (e.g., `flake8` or the project’s `tox`/`pytest`/`pre-commit` hooks) to confirm that the style error is resolved and no new issues are introduced.",
            "Step 5: Verify that the code’s behavior is unchanged if the fix is purely stylistic. For arithmetic expressions, confirm that only whitespace was modified and that no numerical or logical change occurred.",
            "Step 6: Commit the change with a clear message referencing the style fix and, if applicable, any associated issue (e.g., 'Fix missing whitespace around arithmetic operator; fixes CI lint error'). Push the change and ensure the CI build now passes.",
            "Step 7: For future work, consider integrating pre-commit hooks or local lint runs before pushing, so that style issues like E226 are caught and fixed locally instead of breaking CI builds."
