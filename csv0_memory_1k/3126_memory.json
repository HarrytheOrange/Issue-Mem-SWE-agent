        "episodic_memory": "In this incident, the v2.1 documentation build was failing due to a subtle ReStructuredText formatting issue in CHANGELOG.rst. Specifically, the heading for the \"2.1.1 - December 16, 2016\" changelog entry had an underline made of dashes that was one character too short relative to the heading text above it. Sphinx/RST require that the underline length matches or exceeds the title length for section headers. This mismatch caused a parsing error that broke the documentation build for the v2.1 docs. The fix was a one-line change: increase the number of dashes in the underline (`-----------------------` to `-------------------------`) so it properly spans the heading. Unit tests on Travis appeared to fail repeatedly, but the maintainer identified this as a corrupted Travis cache issue unrelated to the change and proceeded to merge the fix, especially since CI had already moved to CircleCI on master.",
        "semantic_memory": "ReStructuredText and Sphinx are strict about heading syntax: the underline characters (e.g., `-`, `=`, `~`) used for section titles must be at least as long as the text of the heading. A single off‑by‑one error in underline length can cause documentation builds to fail, sometimes with cryptic or non-obvious errors. Changelog and release notes files are particularly susceptible because headings are often edited manually. In general, any documentation or markup system with structural syntax (RST, Markdown with extensions, AsciiDoc, etc.) can fail builds when small formatting rules are violated. Therefore, keeping documentation build checks in CI, paying attention to linter warnings, and remembering format-specific constraints (like RST heading lengths) are important best practices for maintaining stable docs builds.",

            "Step 2: Inspect the referenced RST file (e.g., CHANGELOG.rst) around the line indicated by Sphinx, focusing on section titles and their underline/overline lines.",
            "Step 3: For each heading, verify that the underline (and overline, if used) is at least as long as the heading text. Count characters or use an editor that can visually highlight column length.",
            "Step 4: If an underline is too short, extend it by adding the appropriate number of underline characters (`-`, `=`, etc.) so that the line equals or exceeds the length of the heading text.",
            "Step 5: Save the file and rerun the documentation build to confirm that the error is resolved and that no new warnings or errors appear.",
            "Step 6: Add or review any documentation linters (e.g., `sphinx-build -nW`, doc8, rstcheck) in CI to catch similar formatting issues earlier and fail fast with clear diagnostics.",
            "Step 7: If CI still fails but the change is minimal and syntactically correct, check whether the failure is due to an external issue (e.g., corrupted CI cache, environment change). Clear caches or run on a fresh environment to validate.",
            "Step 8: Once confirmed, commit and merge the fix, referencing the doc build failure and the specific heading adjustment in the changelog or PR description."
