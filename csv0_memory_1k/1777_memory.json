        "episodic_memory": "For the napari 0.4.0 release, the team needed proper release notes. A new documentation file `docs/release/release_0_4_0.md` was created to serve as the release notes. It includes an introduction, a highlights section, lists of new features, improvements, bug fixes, API changes, and build/docs changes. One key piece of information added was that napari 0.4.0 drops support for Python 3.6, in line with the NEP-29 deprecation policy, and now requires Python 3.7+. During refinement, the initial website link pointing to the GitHub repo was corrected to the main site `https://napari.org`. The highlights section was expanded to clearly describe the new global coordinate system, scale bar, axes, cursor model, affine transforms support, the new Tracks layer, and ongoing work on experimental asynchronous rendering. Minor wording tweaks were made (e.g., 'biggest release ever' to 'biggest release yet', and clarifying the example data type), and the spelling and presentation of contributor/reviewer names were adjusted (e.g., using 'Alister Burt' instead of the GitHub handle, and updating the reviewer count from 16 to 18 as two more reviewers were acknowledged). Additional entries were added to the improvements and bug-fix lists (e.g., warning on failed save, fixing dask requirement duplication, and welcome screen color adjustments). Overall, this PR was a release-documentation and metadata update rather than a runtime bug fix.",
        "semantic_memory": "Accurate, well-structured release notes are critical for user understanding and project maintenance. They should: (1) clearly communicate breaking changes, such as dropped Python versions or API changes; (2) highlight major new capabilities and improvements in terms meaningful to end users (e.g., global coordinate system, new layer types, scale bar, coordinate reporting); (3) summarize bug fixes and internal improvements, even when they are purely technical, so downstream users and maintainers can track regressions and behaviors; (4) keep links and references (e.g., project website) current and correct; and (5) acknowledge community contributions (authors and reviewers). When changing supported Python versions, it is best practice to reference a widely-accepted policy such as NEP-29, and explicitly state the new minimum version. Small textual fixes—such as adjusting wording for tone, correcting names, and maintaining accurate counts of contributors—improve professionalism and community trust. Even though such PRs are documentation-only, they are an essential part of a reliable release process and should be treated with the same rigor as code changes.",

            "Use a structured template for release notes.",
            "Step 1: Create or update a release notes file (e.g., `docs/release/release_X_Y_Z.md`) using a consistent template with sections like: Introduction, Highlights, New Features, Improvements, Bug Fixes, API Changes & Deprecations, Build Tools & Docs, Contributors, and Reviewers.",
            "Step 2: In the introduction, clearly state the release version, and if applicable, mention whether it is a major/big release and any headline themes.",
            "Step 3: Document compatibility changes explicitly. If dropping or adding supported Python versions, reference a standard policy where applicable (e.g., NEP-29), and clearly state the new minimum required version.",
            "Step 4: Fill in a 'Highlights' section that explains key user-visible changes in plain language (e.g., new data models, new layer types, new visualization capabilities, major performance or UX changes). Focus on what users can now do that they couldn’t before.",
            "Step 5: Enumerate New Features, Improvements, Bug Fixes, API Changes, and Build/Docs changes as bullet lists, ideally referencing issue or PR numbers to aid traceability.",
            "Step 6: Verify and correct all external links in the release notes (e.g., project website, issue tracker). Ensure they point to canonical URLs rather than secondary or outdated locations.",
            "Step 7: Generate or update contributor and reviewer lists based on commit history (e.g., via `git shortlog` or other tooling), then manually polish names (proper capitalization, real names instead of bare handles where appropriate) and keep the reported counts (e.g., '20 authors', '18 reviewers') in sync with the actual lists.",
            "Step 8: Proofread the text for accuracy, clarity, and tone. Adjust phrasing if needed for consistency with project communication style, and correct subtle errors like outdated examples or overly specific examples that might age poorly.",
            "Step 9: Have at least one other maintainer review the release notes for correctness (especially for version support statements, breaking changes, and major features), then merge the PR before tagging and publishing the release.",
            "Step 10: After merging, ensure that the release notes are linked or surfaced in your documentation site or release artifacts (e.g., link from the main docs index or GitHub Releases page) so users can easily discover them."
