        "episodic_memory": "In this incident, a typo was found in Home Assistant's services.yaml file under the homematic integration. The description for the 'name' field of a service parameter contained the misspelling 'varaible' instead of 'variable' (\"Name of the varaible to set\"). This typo affects user-facing service documentation (and any UI that renders these descriptions) but does not impact runtime behavior. The fix was a one-line change updating the description string to \"Name of the variable to set\". The PR also involved process-related feedback: maintainers requested that the contributor sign the CLA and retarget the PR to the 'dev' branch.",
        "semantic_memory": "Even minor documentation typos in configuration or service definition files can negatively impact user experience and perceived quality, especially when those strings are surfaced directly in UIs or API docs. YAML-based service definitions, like those in Home Assistant, are often the single source of truth for parameter names and descriptions; small errors there propagate widely. Maintaining high-quality, consistent descriptions helps users understand how to use services correctly and reduces confusion. From a collaboration perspective, even trivial fixes must respect project contribution workflows (CLA signing, correct target branches). Spelling corrections in code or config should be treated as normal, valid contributions, and reviewers should ensure text clarity and correctness in addition to code logic.",
        "procedural_memory": [
            "When encountering unclear or misspelled text in configuration, service definitions, or API docs, verify whether these strings are user-facing (e.g., shown in UIs, logs, or autogenerated documentation).",
            "Step 1: Locate the source of the text. Search the repository for the exact misspelled string (e.g., 'varaible') to find where it is defined (often in YAML, JSON, or localization files).",
            "Step 2: Confirm the intended wording. Compare with similar parameters or service definitions nearby to ensure consistent terminology (e.g., other references to 'variable').",
            "Step 3: Apply the minimal corrective change. Update only the incorrect portion of the string to avoid accidentally changing behavior (e.g., change 'Name of the varaible to set' to 'Name of the variable to set').",
            "Step 4: Run any available linters or documentation generators that might validate YAML syntax or highlight formatting issues after the change.",
            "Step 5: If the project has a contribution workflow, ensure you follow it: sign the CLA if required, target the correct branch (often a development branch), and conform to commit message or PR title conventions.",
            "Step 6: In the PR description, clearly state that the change is a documentation or typo fix and reference the affected file and field, so reviewers can quickly verify the scope.",
            "Step 7: Optionally suggest or run automated spelling checks on documentation and user-facing strings to catch similar issues early."
