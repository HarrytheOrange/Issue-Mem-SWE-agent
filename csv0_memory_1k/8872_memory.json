        "episodic_memory": "A contributor opened a Home Assistant pull request to add Somfy RTS motor support to the RFLink integration, enabling up, down, and stop commands for shades or blinds. The typical configuration example was:\n\n- platform: rflink\n  devices:\n    RTS_0100F2_0:\n      name: SunShade\n\nHowever, the project’s CLA bot blocked the PR from being accepted because several commits were authored with an email of the form `pascalosinga@imac-van-pascal.local`, which was not linked to any GitHub account. Since the CLA system validates CLA signature on a per-author basis, it could not verify those commits. The maintainers responded explaining that the PR could not be merged until the email issue was resolved, and outlined two remediation paths: (1) add the local email address to the contributor’s GitHub account so the commits retroactively link to their account; or (2) rewrite the commit history to change the authorship information (using `git commit --amend --author=\"Name <email@address>\"` for the latest commit or an interactive rewrite/script for multiple commits). Once the email is properly associated and commits are pushed again, the CLA check can succeed and the functional RFLink Somfy RTS changes can be considered for merge.",
        "semantic_memory": "When contributing to open source projects that enforce Contributor License Agreements (CLAs), all commits in a pull request must be attributable to GitHub accounts that have signed the CLA. If a commit is authored with a local or unregistered email (for example, `user@hostname.local`), GitHub cannot associate it with a user, and CLA verification cannot succeed. This is not a code bug but a process/infrastructure failure: the pull request appears to have unknown authors.\n\nThe general pattern is:\n- Git commit metadata (author name and email) must match an email address registered on the contributor’s GitHub account.\n- CLA/CI tooling operates on the commit author identities as seen by GitHub; any discrepancy breaks automated checks and blocks merges.\n- The remedy is either to (a) register the used email on GitHub or (b) rewrite git history to use a valid, registered email.\n\nFor feature work like integrating new device support (e.g., Somfy RTS into RFLink), the non-technical roadblock is often these contribution process issues rather than the feature itself. Contributors need to ensure their git configuration is correct before pushing work to shared repositories. This provides a generally applicable best practice: always verify `git config user.name` and `git config user.email` are set to your GitHub-linked identity before making commits intended for public PRs.",

            "How to diagnose and fix a pull request blocked due to unlinked commit emails / CLA failure:",
            "Step 1: Identify the problem as a CLA/identity issue, not a code failure. If the project’s bot reports that some commits are not linked to a GitHub account, note the offending commit hashes and emails.",
            "Step 2: Inspect the commits on GitHub. Open one of the reported commit links and look at the author information. GitHub will often show a blue question mark bubble indicating that the email is not associated with an account.",
            "Step 3: Decide which remediation path to take:",
            "Step 3a: If you control the email address used in the commits (e.g., a real personal or work email), go to your GitHub account settings → Emails and add that email address. Confirm the email if required. Once added, GitHub will retroactively associate those commits with your account and CLA tooling should recognize you as the author.",
            "Step 3b: If the email is invalid or not usable (e.g., `user@machine.local`, old domain, or you cannot receive mail there), you must rewrite the commits to use a valid, GitHub-linked email.",
            "Step 4: Fix git author information for future commits. On your local machine, run:\n- `git config --global user.name \"Your Name\"`\n- `git config --global user.email \"your_github_email@example.com\"`\nEnsure this matches an email registered on GitHub.",
            "Step 5: If only the latest commit has the wrong author, amend it with the correct author info:\n- `git commit --amend --author=\"Your Name <your_github_email@example.com>\"`\nThen force-push the branch: `git push --force`.",
            "Step 6: If multiple existing commits in the branch have the wrong author:\n- Option 1 (simpler): Recreate the commits by resetting to a clean base and recommitting changes with correct author info.\n- Option 2 (advanced): Use an interactive history rewrite or GitHub’s recommended script for changing author info across all commits. For example, use `git filter-branch` or `git filter-repo` with proper `--env-filter` to update `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`, `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`, etc., then force-push.",
            "Step 7: After pushing the corrected history, wait for the project’s CLA/CI bot to re-evaluate the pull request. Verify that the CLA status passes and that all commits now show as authored by your GitHub account.",
            "Step 8: Only after the CLA/identity issues are resolved should maintainers review and merge the functional changes (such as adding Somfy RTS support to the RFLink integration and documenting sample `configuration.yaml` entries)."
