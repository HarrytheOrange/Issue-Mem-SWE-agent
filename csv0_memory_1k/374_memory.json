        "episodic_memory": "In this change set, the napari project addressed the absence of a formal Code of Conduct and clear reporting/enforcement procedures. The maintainers borrowed the Code of Conduct and report-handling manual from SciPy and NumPy, then adapted them to napari by changing references to the project name, removing references to a higher steering committee that napari does not yet have, and inserting the names and roles of napari's own Code of Conduct committee.\n\nThey introduced two new top-level documentation files:\n- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md: defines expected behavior, unacceptable conduct (including violent threats, discriminatory language, doxing, misgendering, etc.), a diversity statement, and an overview of how reports are handled.\n- REPORT_HANDLING_MANUAL.md: a detailed manual for the Code of Conduct committee, describing values (empathy, fairness, cultural awareness), use of mediation, what constitutes a clear and severe breach, how to respond to reports, resolution types, record-keeping, and conflict-of-interest handling.\n\nThey configured a dedicated reporting address, napari-conduct@googlegroups.com, and documented the committee members (Juan Nunez-Iglesias as chair, Nicholas Sofroniew, and Kira Evans), plus an external contact (Charlotte Weaver) for cases involving the committee or where reporters prefer an independent person.\n\nSeveral follow-up commits refined Markdown formatting: fixing nested bullet lists, converting free text into ordered lists where appropriate, updating the title of the report manual to reference napari instead of SciPy, and improving wording to explicitly include ableist language and misgendering as unacceptable behavior. Lastly, they added explicit 'Code of Conduct' sections to both README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md, linking to CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md so that contributors and users can easily discover the policy.",
        "semantic_memory": "Generalizable insights from this change:\n\n1. **Projects need a clear Code of Conduct and enforcement process**\n   - Open source and community projects benefit from a written Code of Conduct (CoC) that defines acceptable behavior, lists examples of harassment or exclusion, and states the community’s commitment to diversity and inclusion.\n   - A separate incident response or report-handling manual helps the enforcement body act consistently and fairly, and provides transparency about how reports are processed.\n\n2. **Adapting existing Codes of Conduct is a practical pattern**\n   - Rather than writing a CoC from scratch, it is effective to adopt and adapt well-established templates (e.g., SciPy, NumPy, Contributor Covenant), changing project name references, governance structures, and contact details while preserving proven content.\n   - You must align references to governance bodies (e.g., steering committees) with what actually exists in your project; otherwise, your CoC may refer to processes or entities that don’t exist and can’t act.\n\n3. **Clear reporting channels and roles are essential**\n   - A CoC should specify how to report violations, with a dedicated email address or channel, and name the individuals or committee responsible for handling reports.\n   - Providing at least one external or independent contact (outside the main committee) gives reporters more options when there are conflicts of interest or concerns about bias.\n\n4. **Concrete examples of unacceptable conduct improve clarity**\n   - Listing specific behaviors (e.g., violent threats, racist/sexist/ableist language, doxing, misgendering, unwelcome sexual attention, excessive profanity) reduces ambiguity and helps community members understand expectations.\n   - Updating language to explicitly include forms of discrimination (e.g., ableism, misgendering) is part of maintaining an inclusive, current CoC.\n\n5. **Documentation discoverability matters**\n   - For a CoC to be effective, it must be easy to find. Linking to it from README and CONTRIBUTING is a standard pattern so that both users and contributors see it early.\n   - Small Markdown details (proper list nesting, ordered vs unordered lists) improve readability and reduce confusion in important policy documents.\n\n6. **Incident handling should be structured and time-boxed**\n   - A good manual specifies: how to triage reports, what constitutes a clear and severe breach that may warrant immediate action, timelines to acknowledge and resolve reports, possible resolution types (no action, reminders, reprimands, apologies, temporary or permanent bans), mediation options, and how to record decisions for institutional memory.\n   - Conflict-of-interest guidelines (e.g., recusal when involved) help maintain trust in the process.",

            "Step-by-step instructions on how to introduce or improve a Code of Conduct and incident handling in a project:",
            "Step 1: Identify the need and scope",
            "  - Recognize that the project lacks a formal Code of Conduct or that existing guidelines are incomplete or unclear.\n  - Decide whether you also need a detailed incident handling manual in addition to the CoC text.",
            "Step 2: Select and adapt a template",
            "  - Choose a well-regarded CoC template from a similar project or a standard like SciPy, NumPy, or Contributor Covenant.\n  - Copy the text into a new `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file in the repository root.\n  - Replace project names and URLs with your project's name and links.\n  - Remove or adjust references to governance structures your project does not have (e.g., steering committees, working groups) or update them to match your actual governance.",
            "Step 3: Define reporting channels and responsible people",
            "  - Create a dedicated contact channel (e.g., a mailing list like `project-conduct@googlegroups.com`, a shared inbox, or similar) limited to the CoC committee.\n  - Add this address to the CoC under a reporting or 'How to report' section.\n  - List the names (and optionally links to profiles) of committee members, and clearly mark a chair or primary contact if applicable.\n  - Add one or more external or independent contacts for reporters who cannot or do not want to approach the committee directly.",
            "Step 4: Add an incident response manual",
            "  - If using a template, copy it into a `REPORT_HANDLING_MANUAL.md` (or similar) file.\n  - Update the title and body to reference your project rather than the source project.\n  - Ensure the manual describes:\n    - Core values (empathy, fairness, respect, cultural awareness).\n    - Triage of 'clear and severe' breaches and when to take immediate action (e.g., disconnection from communication channels).\n    - Normal report handling workflow: acknowledge within a set time (e.g., 72 hours), gather information, deliberate, decide.\n    - Possible resolutions (no action, reminders, reprimands, apologies, cooling-off periods, temporary/permanent bans).\n    - Options for mediation when appropriate and voluntary.\n    - Record-keeping and conflict-of-interest handling.",
            "Step 5: Refine language and examples",
            "  - Review the CoC's list of unacceptable behaviors and ensure it includes explicit examples relevant to modern inclusivity concerns: racist/sexist/ableist language, doxing, unwelcome sexual attention, intentional misgendering, etc.\n  - Adjust phrasing to be clear and inclusive.\n  - Ensure references (e.g., to 'clear and severe breaches') are consistent between the CoC and the manual.",
            "Step 6: Fix Markdown formatting for clarity",
            "  - Verify that bullet lists and nested lists render as intended (no stray blockquote characters or misaligned bullets).\n  - Use ordered lists for stepwise procedures where appropriate (e.g., numbered incident-handling steps).\n  - Check headings, links, and anchors (e.g., section links from CoC into the manual) to ensure they are correct and navigable.",
            "Step 7: Integrate the CoC into contributor-facing docs",
            "  - Add a 'Code of Conduct' section to README.md, briefly describing that the project has a CoC and linking to `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.\n  - Similarly, add a CoC section to CONTRIBUTING.md so contributors are explicitly directed to it.\n  - Use consistent wording so users understand that participation implies agreeing to the CoC.",
            "Step 8: Verify and test",
            "  - Build documentation (if applicable) to ensure the new files and links render correctly (e.g., in Sphinx or another doc system).\n  - Click through all added links (internal and external) to verify they are valid.\n  - Confirm that the reporting email address or group is correctly configured and accessible to committee members only.",
            "Step 9: Communicate the change",
            "  - Announce the new or updated CoC to the community (e.g., via release notes, mailing list, forum, or chat).\n  - Clarify how to report incidents and who is on the committee, emphasizing confidentiality and the goal of maintaining a healthy community.",
            "Step 10: Maintain and iterate",
            "  - Periodically review the CoC and manual to ensure they remain current and inclusive.\n  - Update committee membership and contact information as roles change.\n  - Revise language as new best practices for inclusivity and safety evolve."
