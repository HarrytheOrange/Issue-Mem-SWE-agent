        "episodic_memory": "In this PR, the problem was that the project's README had a 'Contribution' section that only linked to CONTRIBUTING.md without giving concrete, actionable entry points for new or returning contributors. Potential contributors were not shown the actual issue queues suited for their experience level. The fix was to enhance the README's Contribution section by: (1) keeping the welcoming message but making it more enthusiastic ('Any contributions to Optuna are more than welcome!'); (2) adding a direct link to GitHub issues labeled `good first issue` with explanatory text that these issues are relatively simple, well-defined, and good starting points for getting familiar with the contribution workflow and the developer community; (3) adding a separate recommendation for users who have already contributed, directing them to issues labeled `contribution-welcome`; and (4) rephrasing the reference to CONTRIBUTING.md to a more general guideline sentence ('For general guidelines how to contribute to the project, take a look at CONTRIBUTING.md'). The PR went through several iterations based on reviewer feedback, adjusting tone, phrasing, and emphasis (e.g., 'new to Optuna' vs 'new contributor', clarifying 'they are relatively simple, well-defined', and emphasizing 'already' in 'If you already have contributed to Optuna'). The net result is a more actionable, friendly, and segmented contributor section that guides different types of contributors directly to suitable work items while still pointing to the full contribution guide.",
        "semantic_memory": "Effective contributor documentation should provide not only general guidelines but also concrete, low-friction entry points into the project. For open-source repos on GitHub, this often means surfacing issue lists filtered by labels such as `good first issue` for newcomers and more advanced labels (e.g., `help wanted`, `contribution-welcome`) for experienced contributors. The README is typically the first document many visitors see, so a concise, welcoming contribution section that points to labeled issues and to the detailed CONTRIBUTING guide significantly improves onboarding and lowers the barrier to entry. Wording matters: segmenting audiences ('If you are new to X...' vs 'If you already have contributed to X...') and keeping the tone encouraging can increase contributor engagement. Iterative refinement with reviewer feedback is common for documentation: reviewers help tune clarity, tone, and specificity, even when there are no code changes. This pattern—linking labeled issues directly in the README and aligning messaging with CONTRIBUTING.md—is a reusable best practice for open-source project maintainers.",
        "procedural_memory": [
            "Step-by-step instructions on how to diagnose and fix similar issues.",
            "Step 1: Identify the documentation gap: Review the README's Contribution (or similar) section and assess whether it only points to a CONTRIBUTING guide or whether it also provides concrete, actionable steps for potential contributors (e.g., specific issues or areas to work on).",
            "Step 2: Inspect existing GitHub labels: Open the repository's issue tracker and review labels such as `good first issue`, `help wanted`, `contribution-welcome`, or project-specific equivalents. Confirm that there are active issues under these labels that are suitable for different contributor experience levels.",
            "Step 3: Segment the contributor audience: Decide on at least two audience segments (e.g., new to the project vs. already contributed or advanced users). Draft short, targeted sentences for each segment, telling them exactly where to look (e.g., 'If you are new to PROJECT, please check the good first issues...').",
            "Step 4: Add direct links to labeled issue lists: In the README Contribution section, add markdown links directly to the label-filtered issue pages (e.g., `https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/labels/good%20first%20issue` and `https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/labels/contribution-welcome`). Include a brief explanation of why these issues are good starting points (simple, well-defined, etc.).",
            "Step 5: Preserve and refine the general contribution link: Keep or add a link to CONTRIBUTING.md, but rephrase it so it complements the issue links: for example, 'For general guidelines on how to contribute to the project, take a look at CONTRIBUTING.md.' Ensure this wording is clear and friendly.",
            "Step 6: Tune tone and clarity: Iterate on the wording to be inclusive and encouraging. Make the welcome message enthusiastic but not verbose. Clarify any ambiguous phrases (e.g., specify that `good first issues` are relatively simple and well-defined).",
            "Step 7: Validate links and labels: Before finalizing, click all added links to confirm they work, point to the correct repo, and use the exact label names that exist in the issue tracker. Update labels or URLs if they have spaces or special characters that require URL encoding.",
            "Step 8: Request and incorporate review feedback: Open a PR with the documentation changes and ask maintainers or documentation-focused contributors to review. Be prepared to adjust language (e.g., 'new contributor' vs 'new to PROJECT', recommendations phrasing, emphasis like 'already contributed') based on stylistic or clarity feedback.",
            "Step 9: Align with other docs: After merging, optionally review CONTRIBUTING.md or other communication sections to ensure they are consistent with the new README wording and that they don't contradict or duplicate the new guidance.",
            "Step 10: Monitor contributor behavior: Over time, watch whether new contributors start referencing `good first issues` or `contribution-welcome` in discussions. Use this feedback to further refine labels, descriptions, and README guidance."
