        "episodic_memory": "In this change set, the repository maintainers introduced automation to improve issue and pull request triage. First, they updated the GitHub issue templates so that each template automatically applies an appropriate default label: the bug report template now includes `labels: bug`, the documentation issue template includes `labels: documentation` and an explicit guidance comment, the feature request template now applies `labels: feature`, and a new task issue template was added with `labels: task` and a short prompt describing the task. \n\nSecond, they added a PR labeler configuration at `.github/labeler.yml` and a corresponding GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/labeler.yml`. The labeler maps file path patterns to labels: `design` for Qt resource files, `documentation` for anything in `docs/`, `preferences` for settings-related files, `qt` for Qt-related Python files, `task` for `.github` changes, `tests` for test files, and `vispy` for vispy-related paths. The workflow uses the `actions/labeler@main` action triggered on `pull_request_target`, with the GitHub token provided via `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`. Documentation comments were also added to link the workflow and config to the labeler marketplace docs, clarifying how to maintain this automation in the future.\n\nThe net effect is that new issues and PRs will be labeled automatically: issues via template defaults and PRs via file-path-based rules, which also makes it easier to generate release notes based on labels.",
        "semantic_memory": "Automating labeling for issues and pull requests in GitHub repositories improves triage, consistency, and downstream tasks like release note generation. Issue templates can include a `labels:` field in the YAML front matter to auto-apply labels when users open issues via those templates. This reduces manual work and ensures that different kinds of reports (bugs, features, documentation, tasks) are consistently categorized.\n\nFor pull requests, GitHub Actions can run a labeler that inspects changed file paths and applies labels according to rules specified in a `.github/labeler.yml` file. This allows maintainers to map certain directories or file patterns (e.g., `docs/**/*`, `**/*/_tests/**/*.py`, components directories) to semantic labels such as `documentation`, `tests`, or component-specific tags (`qt`, `vispy`, `design`). Using the `pull_request_target` event allows the workflow to act on PRs coming from forks while running with repository-level permissions, though it must be used carefully for security-sensitive actions.\n\nIncluding comments and links to marketplace or documentation pages in config and workflow files improves maintainability. As teams evolve, newcomers can quickly understand the purpose of these files and update patterns or labels safely. Automated labeling also provides a structured way to filter issues/PRs for release notes, metrics, or ownership routing.",

            "Step-by-step instructions on how to diagnose and fix similar issues.",
            "Step 1: Decide on your labeling strategy.\nIdentify the main categories you want for issues and PRs (e.g., bug, feature, documentation, task, tests, component-specific labels like qt, ui, backend). Ensure these labels are created in the GitHub repository settings.",
            "Step 2: Add default labels to issue templates.\nLocate your issue templates under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`. For each template file (e.g., `bug_report.md`, `feature_request.md`, `documentation.md`, `task.md`):\n- Edit the YAML front matter at the top.\n- Add a `labels: <label-name>` line corresponding to the desired default label.\n- Optionally update the body of the template to clarify what information the reporter should provide.\n- Commit these changes so new issues created via the templates will automatically receive the correct label.",
            "Step 3: Create or update the PR labeler configuration.\nIn the repository, add a `.github/labeler.yml` file if it doesn’t exist. Define label rules in the form:\n```yaml\ndocumentation:\n  - 'docs/**/*'\n  - 'docs/*'\n\ntests:\n  - '**/*/_tests/**/*.py'\nqt:\n  - 'napari/_qt/**/*.py'\n```\nMap each label to one or more glob patterns that match the file paths you want to trigger that label. Include comments at the top of the file referencing relevant docs (e.g., the GitHub Marketplace page for the labeler) to help future maintainers.",
            "Step 4: Configure the GitHub Actions workflow for the labeler.\nCreate a workflow file at `.github/workflows/labeler.yml` with content similar to:\n```yaml\n# https://github.com/marketplace/actions/labeler\nname: \"Pull Request Labeler\"\non:\n  - pull_request_target\n\njobs:\n  triage:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/labeler@main\n        with:\n          repo-token: \"${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\"\n```\nUse `pull_request_target` if you need the workflow to run on PRs from forks with repository-level permissions (and ensure the action only performs safe operations like labeling). Otherwise, `pull_request` may be safer.",
            "Step 5: Test the labeler behavior.\nOpen or update a test PR that touches files matching your defined patterns. Verify that the workflow runs and that labels are applied automatically to the PR. For issue templates, open test issues via each template and confirm the labels appear as expected.",
            "Step 6: Iterate on patterns and labels.\nMonitor labels over a few PRs and issues. If labels are too broad or too narrow, refine the glob patterns in `.github/labeler.yml`. Add new labels or patterns as your codebase grows (e.g., new components or directories). Keep comments in the workflow and config files up to date with links to external docs or internal guidelines.",
            "Step 7: Leverage labels for downstream processes.\nUse these consistent labels to drive release note generation, dashboards, or ownership triage. For example, filter PRs by `feature` or `bug` labels for changelog entries, or route `documentation` issues to dedicated docs maintainers."
