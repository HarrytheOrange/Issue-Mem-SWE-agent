        "episodic_memory": "In this incident, the issue was not a runtime bug but a documentation inconsistency in the project's developer docs. In docs/developers/CONTRIBUTING.md, a shell code block showing how to install pre-commit used `pre-commit install` without a leading prompt symbol. Other shell examples used a `$` prompt, so this snippet looked visually inconsistent. The PR changed the code block from:\n\n```sh\npre-commit install\n```\n\nto:\n\n```sh\n$ pre-commit install\n```\n\nThere was discussion noting that the command is shell-agnostic and that `$` is not universal to all shells, but the change proceeded for stylistic consistency. The fix was a one-line change in the markdown file, aligning the code block with the project's chosen convention for shell prompts.",
        "semantic_memory": "This case highlights a common documentation quality concern: consistency in command-line examples. In developer documentation, shell commands may be shown either with or without a prompt symbol like `$`. Mixing styles can confuse readers about what to type (e.g., whether to include the `$`) and makes the docs feel less polished. Establishing and following a convention—such as always including `$` for commands and excluding it for copy-paste examples—prevents confusion. It also shows that even minor doc fixes (like adding a prompt symbol) are worth tracking in version control, and they can reveal subtle cross-shell considerations (e.g., `$` is common but not truly universal). The generalizable lesson: documentation is part of the product; keep code blocks consistent in language tags, prompt styles, and formatting so they are trustworthy, readable, and easy to follow.",

            "To fix or improve inconsistent shell code blocks in documentation, follow these steps:",
            "Step 1: Scan the documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING, docs/*.md) for shell or bash code blocks (```sh, ```bash, or similar).",
            "Step 2: Identify the existing convention for command examples (e.g., whether other snippets use a leading '$', '>', or no prompt at all).",
            "Step 3: Decide on a single, clear convention that suits the project (e.g., '$ command' for illustrative examples, bare 'command' for copy-paste blocks) and align with any existing style guide.",
            "Step 4: Update inconsistent code blocks to follow the chosen convention. For example, add or remove the '$' prompt symbol at the start of lines, or adjust the code fence language (```sh vs ```bash) if needed.",
            "Step 5: Re-read the updated snippets from the perspective of a new user: ensure it is obvious what text should be typed and that the prompt symbol itself is not meant to be copied if that is the convention.",
            "Step 6: Run any documentation or linter tools (e.g., markdown linters, pre-commit hooks) to ensure formatting is valid and consistent.",
            "Step 7: In the PR description, explain that this is a documentation consistency fix (e.g., aligning shell prompts or code block style) so reviewers know there is no behavioral code change.",
            "Step 8: Optionally, document the shell snippet convention in a contributor or style guide to prevent future inconsistencies."
