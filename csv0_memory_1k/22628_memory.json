        "episodic_memory": "In this incident, the Home Assistant Z-Wave integration had a configuration option `DEFAULT_CONF_AUTOHEAL` set to `True`, meaning Z-Wave network auto-healing was enabled by default. The Z-Wave auto-heal process, according to the author of Open Z-Wave and community discussion, is actually detrimental to network performance rather than beneficial. Users and maintainers discussed whether to remove auto-heal entirely or just disable its automatic scheduling. To avoid a breaking change but still improve default behavior, the code was updated in `homeassistant/components/zwave/const.py` to change `DEFAULT_CONF_AUTOHEAL` from `True` to `False`. This disables automatic Z-Wave network healing by default while still keeping a manual network heal service available for users who want to trigger it on demand.",
        "semantic_memory": "Configuration defaults in home automation and distributed systems should be conservative and performance-friendly. Features that perform heavy or disruptive maintenance tasks (like automatic Z-Wave network healing) may be attractive in theory but can be harmful in practice, especially when run on a schedule. It is better to: (1) keep such operations available as manual or explicitly configured actions, and (2) set safe defaults that avoid hidden performance penalties for unsuspecting users. When domain experts or upstream library authors indicate that a feature degrades reliability or performance, projects should strongly consider disabling it by default and, where needed, gradually deprecating it. This pattern balances backward compatibility with better out-of-the-box behavior: keep the functionality, but change the default to opt-in instead of opt-out.",

            "When a default-enabled maintenance feature appears to harm performance or stability, evaluate its real-world impact and adjust the default behavior to be safer and more conservative.",
            "Step 1: Identify the problematic behavior: observe user reports, metrics, or expert advice indicating that an automatic maintenance task (e.g., Z-Wave auto-heal) causes performance degradation or instability.",
            "Step 2: Confirm with authoritative sources: consult upstream maintainers, protocol authors, or experienced users to validate whether the feature is indeed harmful or should be used sparingly.",
            "Step 3: Decide on scope of change: determine whether to completely remove the feature, disable its automatic scheduling, or just change its default configuration. Consider backward compatibility and release timing (e.g., avoid breaking changes in minor releases).",
            "Step 4: Locate the configuration default: find the constant or setting that controls the default behavior (here, `DEFAULT_CONF_AUTOHEAL` in `homeassistant/components/zwave/const.py`).",
            "Step 5: Change the default to a safer value: update the default from enabled to disabled (e.g., `DEFAULT_CONF_AUTOHEAL = True` to `DEFAULT_CONF_AUTOHEAL = False`), ensuring the system no longer activates the feature automatically for new setups.",
            "Step 6: Preserve manual controls: verify that a manual service or command still exists (e.g., a Z-Wave network heal service) so advanced users can trigger the operation explicitly when needed.",
            "Step 7: Document the rationale: update release notes, documentation, and possibly UI descriptions to explain why the default changed and how users can still access the functionality manually.",
            "Step 8: Monitor after deployment: after releasing the change, watch for reduced performance complaints, and verify that users who need the feature are able to opt-in via configuration or services."
