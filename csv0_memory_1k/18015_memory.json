        "episodic_memory": "In this incident, a contributor opened a pull request titled 'thankyou!' that added a single new file named 'thankyou' containing a tiny HTML snippet with a 'Thank You' heading. The file was not referenced by any part of the Home Assistant codebase, did not implement a feature, fix a bug, or add tests, and did not follow the project’s normal configuration or component patterns. Additionally, the contributor had not signed the Contributor License Agreement (CLA). A project maintainer responded by requesting that the CLA be signed before the PR could be reviewed or merged. Functionally, this PR did not change application behavior and was effectively a non-contribution or spammy addition, so it would not be merged as-is.",
        "semantic_memory": "This case illustrates several generalizable principles for managing open source contributions and maintaining codebase quality. First, repositories often receive pull requests that do not implement meaningful changes—such as gratitude notes, test files, or arbitrary HTML or text files unconnected to the system. These should be treated as non-functional and typically not merged, because they increase clutter, can confuse other contributors, and provide no value to end users. Second, most mature projects enforce contribution processes, including signing a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) and following templates for issues and pull requests. If a PR does not meet these requirements, maintainers should request compliance and may close the PR if it remains non-compliant or irrelevant. Third, any change should be evaluated on whether it improves functionality, fixes a bug, adds tests, updates documentation, or materially improves developer experience. Files that are not integrated into the build, runtime, or documentation pipeline are usually noise. Finally, automated and human triage need to distinguish between valid contributions and accidental or spam PRs and respond appropriately but politely.",

            "Step-by-step instructions on how to diagnose and fix similar issues (irrelevant or non-functional pull requests):",
            "Step 1: Inspect the diff for functional relevance.",
            "Check what files are changed and whether they are part of the actual product code, tests, or documentation. If the change is just an arbitrary new file (e.g., a random HTML or text file) that is not referenced anywhere, it is likely non-functional.",
            "Step 2: Determine if the change follows project structure and conventions.",
            "Verify that new files conform to the repository’s established directory structure, naming conventions, and patterns (e.g., components, integrations, docs). If not, and there’s no clear rationale, treat it as suspicious or non-contributory.",
            "Step 3: Assess whether the PR addresses an issue or feature request.",
            "Look for a linked issue, a clear description, or a checklist explaining the purpose. If the PR does not reference an issue and contains only cosmetic or unrelated content, it likely does not belong in the repo.",
            "Step 4: Check contribution requirements (CLA, tests, docs).",
            "Confirm whether the contributor has signed the CLA (if the project requires one) and whether any required tests or documentation updates are present for meaningful changes. If the CLA is not signed, request that the contributor sign it before further review.",
            "Step 5: Communicate clearly and politely with the contributor.",
            "If the PR is non-functional or off-topic, reply with a brief explanation: that the repository is for code, tests, or documentation related to the project, and that unrelated files cannot be merged. If applicable, provide links to contribution guidelines.",
            "Step 6: Label and triage the PR.",
            "Apply appropriate labels (e.g., 'invalid', 'spam', or 'needs-cla') in line with project policies. This helps maintainers quickly identify and process similar PRs in the future.",
            "Step 7: Decide on closure vs. revision.",
            "If the PR is purely non-functional (like a 'thank you' HTML page) with no realistic path to being turned into a valid contribution, close it with a short explanation. If the PR is misguided but has potential, ask the contributor to revise it to address a real issue or feature.",
            "Step 8: Keep the repository clean.",
            "Do not merge files that are not used by the codebase or documentation system. Avoid clutter to keep history, search, and maintenance manageable.",
            "Step 9: Optionally improve automation.",
            "If similar non-functional PRs are common, consider adding templates, bots, or CI checks (e.g., requiring CLA status) to automatically flag such PRs and reduce manual triage overhead."
