        "episodic_memory": "In this pull request, the contributor updated .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md for a Pokémon Go bot project in response to a large wave of bans affecting many users. The project was receiving many repetitive GitHub issues about the same known ban/softban symptoms (accounts logging in but not spinning forts, logging in but not catching Pokémon, or not logging in at all, plus infinite loops between two forts). To reduce the number of redundant issues and improve triage, the template was modified to add a prominent header describing these specific known problems and clearly stating that any new issues created about these topics would be closed without explanation. Additionally, the template was enhanced to request the branch (dev or master) in the 'Other Information' section, alongside Git commit and Python version, to provide better context for valid bug reports. There was no code change to runtime behavior; the change is purely in process/documentation, aimed at improving issue quality and maintainer workload.",
        "semantic_memory": "When an open-source project experiences a widely known external incident (e.g., an upstream outage, API changes, ban waves, or service disruptions) that triggers a spike in repetitive bug reports, it is effective to update the GitHub issue template to front-load this information. A clear notice about known issues, including specific symptoms and a policy that such reports will be closed, can significantly reduce duplicate issues and set expectations with users. Furthermore, ensuring that issue templates request key diagnostic metadata (such as branch, commit hash, environment, and version information) improves the quality and triage speed of the issues that are submitted. This pattern is a project management and maintainability tactic rather than a code-level bug fix, but it has substantial impact on developer productivity.",

            "Step 2: Summarize the known issue clearly, including concrete symptoms users are likely to observe, and verify that the maintainers understand and acknowledge the issue.",
            "Step 3: Update .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md (or the relevant issue template) to add a prominent section at the top describing the known issue and listing its main symptoms.",
            "Step 4: Explicitly state the project’s policy for such reports (e.g., 'Issues related to the above known problems will be closed without further explanation') to discourage duplicate reports.",
            "Step 5: While editing the template, ensure it asks for all essential diagnostic information: branch (e.g., dev or master), latest commit hash, OS, runtime versions (Python, Node, etc.), and relevant configuration snippets.",
            "Step 6: Merge the issue template update into the branch used by GitHub for templates (typically the default branch) so that new issues will immediately use the updated template.",
            "Step 7: Optionally post a pinned issue or project announcement referencing the known problem and linking to any central tracking issue or status page.",
            "Step 8: During triage, close new issues that match the documented known problem, referencing the policy in the template if necessary, and encourage users to follow the central discussion if one exists.",
            "Step 9: Once the underlying known issue is resolved or no longer relevant, revisit and clean up the template to remove or update the warning so users are not misled by outdated information."
