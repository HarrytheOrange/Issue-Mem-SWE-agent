        "episodic_memory": "In this change set, the repository maintainers improved the project's README to better expose its community and support channels rather than fixing a runtime bug. Initially, a Gitter badge was added to the top of README.md alongside existing badges (CircleCI, Read the Docs, Codecov). The badge links to the Optuna Gitter room at https://gitter.im/optuna/optuna. The image source was first added as a PNG, then updated to use the SVG variant (https://badges.gitter.im/optuna/gitter.svg) to match the other vector badges and provide better visual quality.\n\nFollowing review feedback referencing a previous discussion, the author added a new \"Communication\" section to the README. This section lists recommended channels for different types of interactions:\n- GitHub Issues for bug reports, feature requests, and questions.\n- Gitter for interactive chat with developers.\n- Stack Overflow for questions tagged with \"optuna\".\n\nThe links are defined using Markdown reference-style definitions at the bottom of the section: [GitHub issues], [Gitter], and [Stack Overflow]. During review, the wording \"and etc.\" in the GitHub Issues bullet was refined to \"and questions\" to be more natural. The final commit also ensured proper formatting at the end of the README (no missing trailing newline).\n\nThese documentation updates do not change any code behavior or test coverage; they purely improve discoverability of support channels and polish the README.",
        "semantic_memory": "This PR illustrates best practices for making open-source projects more approachable and maintainable through documentation rather than code changes.\n\nKey generalizable ideas:\n1. **Expose communication channels prominently**: Placing badges for chat or community platforms (e.g., Gitter, Slack, Discord) at the top of the README, alongside CI and documentation badges, makes it obvious where users can get help or discuss the project.\n2. **Dedicated communication section**: A \"Communication\" or \"Community\" section that clearly lists channels (issue tracker, chat, Q&A sites, mailing lists) and what each should be used for helps funnel requests to appropriate places and reduces noise in the issue tracker.\n3. **Different tools for different purposes**:\n   - GitHub Issues: bug reports, feature requests, and more official Q&A.\n   - Chat (Gitter/Slack/Discord): interactive, real-time discussion and quick questions.\n   - Stack Overflow: searchable, long-lived Q&A that can help future users.\n   Explicitly stating this guidance in the README improves community workflows and support quality.\n4. **Consistent badge formats**: Using SVG badges instead of PNG aligns with modern conventions for README badges (better scaling, sharper rendering, often theme-aware) and keeps the badge row visually consistent.\n5. **Polished language and formatting**: Small text improvements (avoiding awkward phrases like \"and etc.\") and maintaining proper Markdown formatting (e.g., trailing newline, reference-style links) contribute to a professional appearance and better readability.\n\nOverall, the pattern is: treat documentation and community entry points as first-class citizens. Enhancements here can meaningfully improve user experience and engagement without touching runtime code.",

            "When you need to add or improve community/communication information for a project, follow a systematic process:",
            "Step 1: Identify all active communication channels (e.g., GitHub Issues, chat platform like Gitter/Slack/Discord, Q&A tags on Stack Overflow, mailing lists, forums). Confirm their URLs and intended usage.",
            "Step 2: Obtain appropriate badges for any chat or community platforms you want to advertise at the top of the README. Most services (Gitter, Slack, Discord, etc.) provide a badge URL; prefer SVG (`.svg`) variants over PNG for better quality and consistency.",
            "Step 3: Edit the README’s badge section (usually at the very top) and add the new badge Markdown in the same style as existing badges, e.g.: `[![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/owner/project.svg)](https://gitter.im/owner/project)`.",
            "Step 4: Add a dedicated \"Communication\" or \"Community\" section in the README (or update an existing one). Use clear bullet points to describe each channel and its purpose, for example:\n- GitHub Issues for bug reports, feature requests and questions.\n- Chat (Gitter/Slack/Discord) for interactive discussion with developers.\n- Stack Overflow for user questions with a specific tag.",
            "Step 5: Define any Markdown reference-style links used in that section (e.g., `[GitHub issues]: https://github.com/org/repo/issues`, `[Gitter]: https://gitter.im/org/repo`, `[Stack Overflow]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/your-tag`) near the bottom of the README or directly under the section for clarity.",
            "Step 6: Review and polish the language: avoid awkward phrasing like \"and etc.\", be concise, and ensure each bullet clearly states what the channel is for. Check capitalization consistency (e.g., \"GitHub Issues\" vs \"Github Issues\").",
            "Step 7: Preview the README (e.g., in GitHub's preview or a Markdown viewer) to ensure badges render correctly, links work, and the new section fits logically in the document structure.",
            "Step 8: Run linters or formatting checks if the project uses them (for Markdown or docs) and fix any issues, including ensuring the file ends with a newline and there are no Markdown syntax errors.",
            "Step 9: In the PR description, explain that the change is documentation-focused (no code behavior changes) and highlight the newly added communication channels and their intended use so reviewers understand the motivation."
