        "episodic_memory": "A contributor opened a pull request titled 'fourth' against the Home Assistant core repo. The PR adds a new file `conti.md` containing what appears to be a simple Python script demonstrating conversion between integers and binary, but it is stored as a markdown file and is not wired into any part of the Home Assistant codebase. There is no reference to an actual Home Assistant issue, and no configuration, integration, or test changes. A maintainer asked the author to sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA), and another community member labeled the PR as 'SPAM'. The change is clearly unrelated to the project’s functionality and does not fix a bug or implement a feature, so it is effectively a spam or practice PR that should be closed without merge.",
        "semantic_memory": "In large open-source projects, some pull requests are unrelated to the codebase or its roadmap—often containing example scripts, student exercises, or other arbitrary files. These 'spam' or practice PRs create noise and can waste reviewer time if not quickly identified. Good repository hygiene requires maintainers and automation to check for: (1) the presence of meaningful changes tied to issues or features, (2) adherence to contribution guidelines (tests, docs, coding style), and (3) legal prerequisites like a signed CLA. When a PR simply adds an unrelated file, especially outside standard directories and with no tests, docs, or references to project components, it is usually out-of-scope. Such PRs should be promptly closed, optionally labeled (e.g., 'invalid' or 'spam'), and not merged. This preserves code quality and keeps the review queue focused on relevant contributions. Automated checks (like verifying changed paths, presence of integration references, or templates) can help triage these quickly.",

            "Step-by-step instructions on how to diagnose and fix similar issues.",
            "Step 1: Inspect the diff for project relevance.\n- Check which files are modified or created.\n- If the change is a new arbitrary file (e.g., a markdown file with a standalone script) outside standard project structure (components, tests, docs), treat it as potentially unrelated.",
            "Step 2: Verify linkage to an issue or feature.\n- Look for a referenced issue number or a clear description of the bug/feature in the PR body.\n- If the PR description is empty or generic and does not tie into the project (no integration name, no feature description), flag it as suspicious.",
            "Step 3: Assess whether the code integrates with the project.\n- Confirm whether new code is imported, registered, or referenced from existing modules.\n- If the code is standalone and never used (e.g., a demo script in a random file), it does not belong in the main repository.",
            "Step 4: Check contribution prerequisites.\n- Confirm that the contributor has signed the CLA if the repository requires it.\n- Check that tests and documentation changes are present when appropriate.\n- Lack of these, combined with an unrelated change, further indicates spam or low-quality contribution.",
            "Step 5: Communicate clearly and label appropriately.\n- If you determine the PR is out-of-scope or spam, add a brief, polite comment explaining that the change is unrelated to the project and will not be merged.\n- Apply an appropriate label (e.g., 'invalid', 'spam', or 'out-of-scope') according to project policies.",
            "Step 6: Close the PR.\n- Close the pull request without merging.\n- If this appears to be a learning attempt rather than malicious spam, optionally point the contributor to documentation on how to contribute correctly or to practice repositories.",
            "Step 7: Prevent recurrence where possible.\n- Consider adding or improving contribution templates that ask for: related issue, integration name, and test details.\n- Use bots or CI checks to detect PRs that only add arbitrary files in non-standard locations or that fail to modify any application, test, or documentation code paths.\n- Educate contributors via CONTRIBUTING.md and issue/PR templates about what constitutes an acceptable change."
