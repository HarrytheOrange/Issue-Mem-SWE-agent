        "episodic_memory": "In this change, the issue was that the console messages shown during Pokémon capture were vague and not very user-friendly. Specifically, when a throw missed, the text simply printed 'Missed, do it again!', and when a Pokémon was caught, it printed 'Got it, keep good ones' or 'got it, keep it' depending on its CP relative to a configured threshold. Users had little insight into what was happening, especially when low-CP Pokémon were automatically transferred.\n\nThe fix updated the string literals used in the encount_and_catch_pokemon function in working.py. When the catch status is 2 (missed), the message now reads '[-] Attempted to capture pokemon - failed.. trying again!', making it clearer that the system is automatically retrying. When the catch status is 1 (success) and the CP is below config.cp, the message now reads 'Captured Pokemon! [CP<cp>] - exchanging for candy', explicitly mentioning the CP and the ensuing transfer action. When the CP is above the threshold, the message now reads 'Captured Pokemon! [CP<cp>]', again including the CP value. No logic changes were made; only the user-facing text was improved to better reflect the actual behavior (successful capture, CP value, and whether the Pokémon is being kept or transferred).",
        "semantic_memory": "Clear, descriptive user feedback is essential in automation scripts and CLI tools, especially when actions have side effects (like auto-transferring game entities). Vague messages such as 'Got it, keep it' or 'Missed, do it again!' can leave users uncertain about what the system is actually doing.\n\nA better pattern is to:\n- Explicitly describe the operation outcome (success, failure, retry).\n- Include important contextual data (e.g., CP value, thresholds) in the message.\n- Clarify any automatic follow-up actions (e.g., 'exchanging for candy', 'retrying', 'skipping').\n- Keep messages consistent in tone and format to make logs easy to scan.\n\nThis improves user trust, reduces confusion, and makes log files far more useful for debugging or auditing behavior, even when no underlying functional bug exists. Text-only changes can significantly improve UX without changing core logic.",

            "Step 4: Update the code where the messages are emitted (e.g., print/log statements in the relevant function). In this case, modify the strings in encount_and_catch_pokemon for the different status branches.",
            "Step 5: Re-run the flow to verify that each possible path (miss, capture below threshold, capture above threshold) prints the new, clearer messages with correct interpolated values.",

            "Step 7: Optionally, standardize formatting across messages (prefixes, brackets, tags like '[-]') and ensure they are suitable for any downstream log parsing if applicable."
