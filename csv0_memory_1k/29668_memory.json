        "episodic_memory": "In this pull request, the GeoNet NZ Quakes integration in Home Assistant was updated to comply with PEP8 import ordering rules. The contributor used isort to automatically reorder and group imports in both the integration source files and their associated tests. Files touched included `__init__.py`, `config_flow.py`, `geo_location.py`, and the test modules for config flow, geo location, and sensor behavior. Changes consisted solely of rearranging imports: standard library imports first, then third-party, then Home Assistant local imports; within each group, imports were alphabetized, and combined imports from the same module were reordered consistently. The code owner reviewed the changes and confirmed there was no functional impact. All tests passed, confirming that the refactor preserved behavior while improving style consistency.",
        "semantic_memory": "Maintaining consistent import ordering according to PEP8 is a common style requirement in Python projects, especially large ones like Home Assistant. Tools such as isort can automate this process, reducing manual effort and avoiding style-related noise in reviews. PEP8-compliant import ordering typically respects both grouping (standard library, third-party, local application imports) and alphabetization within groups. Applying such style-only refactors should be accompanied by running the full test suite to ensure no subtle import-related behavior changes (such as circular imports or late imports) are introduced. In shared codebases, enforcing import style via automated tools reduces friction among contributors and keeps diffs focused on real behavioral changes instead of formatting.",

            "Use automated tools to enforce import ordering and style across a codebase to avoid manual and inconsistent formatting.",
            "Step 1: Identify the files or modules that have imports not conforming to your project's style guide (e.g., PEP8 for Python). In this case, the GeoNet NZ Quakes integration files and their tests.",
            "Step 2: Configure isort (or your chosen formatter) according to project standards. For Home Assistant, ensure that configuration matches the repository's established isort settings (usually provided in `pyproject.toml`, `setup.cfg`, or similar).",
            "Step 3: Run isort on the target files, either via the command line (e.g., `isort path/to/file.py`) or via a pre-commit hook / IDE integration, to reorder and group imports automatically.",
            "Step 4: Verify that imports are grouped correctly: standard library imports first, then third-party dependencies, then local package imports. Within each group, ensure the imports are alphabetized and combined appropriately.",
            "Step 5: Check that import reordering did not introduce any circular import problems or change lazy import behavior that some modules might rely on. Look especially at modules with side effects on import.",
            "Step 6: Run the project's test suite (`tox`, `pytest`, or the project's standard test command) to ensure there are no regressions and that behavior remains unchanged.",
            "Step 7: Submit the changes as a style-only PR, clearly documenting that the modifications are non-functional (import ordering only), so reviewers can focus on verifying there is no unintended side effect.",
            "Step 8: For future work, consider integrating isort (and other linters/formatters) into CI or pre-commit hooks to keep the codebase consistently formatted without repeated large style-only diffs."
