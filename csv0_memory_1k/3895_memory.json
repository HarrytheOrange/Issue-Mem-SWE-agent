        "episodic_memory": "In this case, the repository maintainers were experiencing confusion and misuse of their GitHub issue tracker and support channels. Users were opening issues for configuration help and feature requests, and PRs were not always targeted at the correct branch. The fix was a README.md update that: (1) clarifies that the project has two main branches (`dev` as beta and `master` as stable) and explicitly instructs contributors to submit PRs to the `dev` branch; (2) introduces a dedicated 'Support' section that explains where to go for different needs: Slack for configuration issues and general help, GitHub Issues for confirmed bugs (with a reminder to search existing issues and use a template), and Feathub for feature requests and voting. These documentation changes are aimed at guiding user behavior, improving triage efficiency, and reducing noise in the issue tracker.",
        "semantic_memory": "Clear, explicit documentation about support channels and contribution workflows significantly reduces misuse of issue trackers and improves project maintainability. Users often default to opening GitHub issues for any problem or idea unless the README strongly directs them otherwise and provides easy links. Separating channels by purpose—chat (e.g., Slack/Discord) for configuration help and general support, issue tracker for reproducible bugs, and a dedicated tool (e.g., Feathub, GitHub Discussions, or a voting board) for feature requests—helps maintainers triage faster and keeps the issue tracker focused on actionable defects. Additionally, specifying the correct target branch for pull requests (e.g., always `dev` instead of `master`) prevents workflow friction and reduces the need for maintainers to manually retarget or reject PRs. Good documentation is an important part of 'bug prevention': by configuring user funnels correctly, many 'issues' never need to be created in the first place.",
        "procedural_memory": [
            "Step 1: Identify pain points in project communication and workflows. Look at the issue tracker and support channels to see recurring misuse patterns: users filing support questions and feature requests as bugs, or PRs targeting the wrong branch.",
            "Step 2: Decide on a clear channel strategy. Assign one channel for real-time help (Slack/Discord), one for bug reports (GitHub Issues), and one for feature requests (Feathub, GitHub Discussions, or a roadmap/voting tool). Define what belongs in each channel.",
            "Step 3: Update the README to reflect this strategy. Add a dedicated 'Support' or 'Getting Help' section near the top. For each type of request (configuration help, bug reports, feature requests), describe the correct channel and why.",
            "Step 4: Provide direct, frictionless links. Include separate links for joining chat (first-time signup vs. returning users), viewing the issue list, creating a new issue, and accessing the feature request hub. This reduces the chance that users ignore the guidance out of convenience.",
            "Step 5: Add contributor workflow guidance. Explicitly state the branching model (e.g., 'dev' as beta, 'master' as stable) and which branch PRs must target. Phrase it as a clear instruction (e.g., 'Make sure to submit your PRs to dev').",
            "Step 6: Encourage good bug report hygiene. In the bug-reporting section, instruct users to search existing issues first, link a filtered search (e.g., sorted by updated date), and reference any issue template they must follow. This ensures higher-quality bug reports.",
            "Step 7: Redirect feature requests away from issues. Explicitly ask users not to open issues for feature requests and instead use the feature hub. Encourage voting on existing features to help prioritize development.",
            "Step 8: Monitor the impact after deployment. After merging the README changes, observe whether new issues better align with expectations, and whether feature requests and support questions migrate to the appropriate channels.",
            "Step 9: Iterate on messaging as needed. If confusion persists, refine wording, formatting (e.g., headings, bullet points, bolding), or link placement to make the guidance even more visible and unambiguous."
