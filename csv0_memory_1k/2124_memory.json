        "episodic_memory": "In this specific change set, the Optuna team decided to formally deprecate the older multi-objective optimization module that lived under `optuna/multi_objective`. Previously, these components were marked as experimental using the `@experimental` decorator, which signaled instability but did not give a concrete deprecation/removal timeline.\n\nTo migrate to a new multi-objective implementation while maintaining clarity for users, the PR replaces all `@experimental` annotations on public APIs in this module with `@deprecated`, and imports the correct decorator from `optuna._deprecated` instead of `optuna._experimental`.\n\nThe changes include:\n- In `optuna/multi_objective/samplers/_base.py`, `BaseMultiObjectiveSampler` is now annotated with `@deprecated(\"2.4.0\", \"4.0.0\")` instead of `@experimental(\"1.4.0\")`.\n- In `optuna/multi_objective/samplers/_motpe.py`, `MOTPEMultiObjectiveSampler` changes from `@experimental(\"2.3.0\")` to `@deprecated(\"2.4.0\", \"4.0.0\")`.\n- In `optuna/multi_objective/samplers/_nsga2.py`, `NSGAIIMultiObjectiveSampler` is similarly updated from `@experimental(\"1.5.0\")` to `@deprecated(\"2.4.0\", \"4.0.0\")`.\n- In `optuna/multi_objective/samplers/_random.py`, `RandomMultiObjectiveSampler` receives the same deprecation change.\n- In `optuna/multi_objective/study.py`, the public functions `create_study` and `load_study`, and the `MultiObjectiveStudy` class are all updated from experimental to deprecated with the same version range.\n- In `optuna/multi_objective/trial.py`, both `MultiObjectiveTrial` and `FrozenMultiObjectiveTrial` switch from `@experimental(\"1.4.0\")` to `@deprecated(\"2.4.0\", \"4.0.0\")`.\n- In `optuna/multi_objective/visualization/_pareto_front.py`, `plot_pareto_front` is similarly marked deprecated instead of experimental.\n\nNo runtime behavior or business logic is changed; only decorators and imports are updated. The purpose is to signal to users that these multi-objective APIs are scheduled for removal in Optuna 4.0.0 and they should migrate to the newer multi-objective interface. This is framed as part of a broader effort (referenced as issue #1980) to replace the previous multi-objective module.",
        "semantic_memory": "This PR illustrates a clean pattern for evolving a public API from experimental to deprecated while communicating a clear migration timeline.\n\nKey generalizable concepts:\n1. **Transitioning API lifecycle states**: Public APIs often move through phases: experimental → stable → deprecated → removed. When moving from experimental to deprecated, you should:\n   - Replace `experimental` annotations with `deprecated` annotations.\n   - Include explicit version numbers for when the API became deprecated and when it will be removed.\n   - Apply the change consistently across all public entry points of the module.\n\n2. **Consistency across a module**: The PR systematically updates all public symbols in the `multi_objective` package: samplers, study/trial abstractions, and visualization helpers. Having a single module with mixed lifecycle states (some experimental, some deprecated, some stable) is confusing, so aligning them reduces user confusion.\n\n3. **Deprecation as communication, not just code change**: Marking functions/classes as deprecated via decorators (or similar tooling) ensures that users see warnings at import/time-of-use and that documentation can accurately reflect lifecycle state. Adding version information (`deprecated_since`, `removed_in`) helps users plan migrations.\n\n4. **Non-breaking incremental migration**: The code does not change behavior; it only changes metadata/annotations. This allows existing code to continue working while giving users clear signals that they must migrate before a future major release.\n\n5. **Centralized deprecation mechanism**: Using a centralized decorator (here `optuna._deprecated.deprecated`) standardizes how deprecation is implemented (e.g., message format, warning type, logging). This is preferable to ad-hoc warnings scattered across the codebase.\n\nOverall, the pattern is: when deprecating a whole subsystem in favor of a new design, first mark all affected public APIs as deprecated with clear versioning, keep behavior unchanged, and then only remove them in a later major version.",

            "Step-by-step instructions on how to diagnose and fix similar issues (transitioning experimental APIs to deprecated status, or deprecating an old module in favor of a new one).",
            "Step 1: Identify the scope of deprecation.\n- Enumerate all public classes, functions, and modules that belong to the subsystem you want to deprecate.\n- Include not just core logic (e.g., samplers) but also supporting abstractions (e.g., study/trial types) and utilities (e.g., visualization functions).",
            "Step 2: Confirm or implement a standard deprecation mechanism.\n- Ensure there is a central deprecation helper (e.g., a `deprecated` decorator) that:\n  - Emits consistent warnings (e.g., `DeprecationWarning` or a project-specific warning).\n  - Accepts parameters such as `deprecated_since` and `removed_in`.\n- If such a helper does not exist, implement it before bulk updates.",
            "Step 3: Replace experimental annotations with deprecated annotations.\n- For each API currently marked as experimental (e.g., `@experimental(\"1.4.0\")`):\n  - Change the import to reference the deprecation helper (e.g., `from project._deprecated import deprecated` instead of `from project._experimental import experimental`).\n  - Replace the decorator with one that communicates deprecation, including version information (e.g., `@deprecated(\"2.4.0\", \"4.0.0\")`).\n- Ensure that you propagate these changes consistently across all files in the deprecated module.",
            "Step 4: Choose appropriate version numbers.\n- `deprecated_since`: the version where the API officially becomes deprecated (current or upcoming minor/major release).\n- `removed_in`: the targeted major version where the API will be removed.\n- Align these numbers with project release policy (e.g., deprecate in 2.x, remove in 4.0).",
            "Step 5: Avoid changing behavior in the deprecation PR.\n- Keep logic and API signatures intact to avoid breaking changes.\n- Restrict the PR to lifecycle metadata (decorators, documentation, imports) unless a bug forces a behavior fix.",
            "Step 6: Update documentation and release notes.\n- Update user-facing docs to indicate that the module/APIs are deprecated and link to the new replacement APIs.\n- Add migration guidance (e.g., \"Use `new_module.create_study` instead of `multi_objective.create_study`\").\n- Mention the deprecation in the changelog, highlighting the removal target version.",
            "Step 7: Run tests and static analysis.\n- Ensure the test suite still passes after swapping decorators.\n- If you have tests that inspect deprecation warnings, update them to expect the new decorator behavior and messages.",
            "Step 8: Communicate to reviewers and users.\n- Reference the broader tracking issue (e.g., `#1980`) in the PR description to show how this deprecation fits into the long-term plan.\n- Clearly state that the PR does not change runtime behavior, only lifecycle annotations, to make review and adoption smoother."
